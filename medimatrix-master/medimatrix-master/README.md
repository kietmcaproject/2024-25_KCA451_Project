# Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Tracking System

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

The **Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Tracking System** is a web-based solution designed to streamline pharmaceutical supply chain processes. It includes features such as inventory management, vendor management, shipment tracking, and real-time notifications for low stock and drug expiry. Built with **React.js**, **Firebase**, and **Material UI**, the system ensures efficiency, transparency, and improved healthcare delivery.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage inventory, vendors, and shipments.
- **Hospital Dashboard**: Place orders and track shipments.
- **Vendor Dashboard**: Update shipment statuses and view orders.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts for low stock and approaching drug expiry dates.
- **Secure Authentication**: User access control using Firebase Auth.
